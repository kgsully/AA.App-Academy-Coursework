Step 1: Generate a migration file -
        Used the command
        > npx sequelize-cli migration:generate --name create-color
        to generate the migration for this Step

Step 4: Run the migration -
        Used the command
        > dotenv npx sequelize-cli db:migrate
        to run the migration that was created in step 1, and configured in steps 2 and 3.
        'dotenv' was used in order for npx to use the environment variable(s) defined in the .env file
        when the command was executed.

Step 5: Validate the table creation -
        Validation from sqlite3:

        sqlite> .tables
        Colors         SequelizeMeta

        sqlite> .schema Colors
        CREATE TABLE `Colors` (`id` INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, `name` VARCHAR(50));
