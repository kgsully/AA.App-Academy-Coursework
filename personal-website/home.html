                Hi! I'm Ken S. - an aspiring software developer / engineer and I've built this basic profile website
                as an exercise / project during the course of my learning journey to change careers to software development.
                I've always loved computers and programming, and I've decided to take the plunge to make the change to do it as a
                career.

            <h2>Professional</h2>
            <p>
                I am a licensed engineer with a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering. During the course of my career,
                I've worked as a mechanical engineer and a control systems / industrial automation engineer in a variety of industries.
                My engineering experience includes working for companies and clients in Oil & Gas, Power Generation, Pharmaceutical, Manufacturing,
                and Food and Beverage spaces. Control systems design / commissioning / and troubleshooting experience extends from hardware
                (industrial control panels) and instrumentation, to software - PLC programming (batch, continuous, etc), HMI programming,
                historical data capture and reporting, to server configuration and network achitecture design.
                <br>
                I'm now studying to become a software developer / engineer.
